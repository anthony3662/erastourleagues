The candy coated colours of this Versace bodysuit are an on-brand callout to the Lover aesthetic while also being very signature to the iridescent embellishments that Versace is known for. This is what you call perfect brand alignment - what a great designer to bring this vision to life. @taylorswiftstyled",
