    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

    <h2>Fan Project and Donations</h2>
    <p>
      Eras Tour Leagues is a fan project dedicated to providing an enjoyable experience for Taylor Swift fans. The App is monetized solely
      through donations, which help support the development and maintenance of the App. Donations are voluntary and are not required for
      using the App or participating in its activities.
    </p>

    <h2>Fair Play and Insider Information</h2>
    <p>Users of Eras Tour Leagues are expected to play fairly and adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A user who works for Taylor Swift or otherwise has access to insider information related to Taylor Swift's activities may not change
        their lineups, offer trades, or accept trades while they have access to such insider information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using insider information to gain an unfair advantage in the App's activities will result in disqualification from winning prizes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prize Acceptance and Anti-Scalping Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      If a user wins a prize through Eras Tour Leagues, they may be required to sign an Anti-Scalping Agreement to accept the prize. By
      accepting the prize, the user agrees not to sell any part of the prize for more than its original retail value. Violation of this
      agreement may result in the forfeiture of the prize and account deactivation.
    </p>

    <h2>Donations and Odds of Winning</h2>
    <p>
      Donations made to Eras Tour Leagues have no impact on a user's odds of winning prizes. The App operates on a fair and unbiased basis,
      where prize winners are determined based on their performance and adherence to the App's rules and guidelines.
    </p>

    <h2>Scoring Disagreements</h2>
    <p>
      While we strive for accuracy and cross-check information from multiple sources, Eras Tour Leagues is not responsible for any scoring
      disagreements that may arise during the use of the App. In case of disputes, the App administrators will make reasonable efforts to
      resolve the issue and ensure fair outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify or update these Terms of Use at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to review
