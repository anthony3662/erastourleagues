        Statement On Litigation

        Snowglobe Allie threatened to sue me and doxx me. Her case is meritless. Originally, I was going to move on and live my life.
        However, I’ve had trouble my entire life standing up for myself and my achievements. I’ve spent years trying to be diplomatic with
        those who aren’t even listening. I spent 200 hours over 7 weeks on my project and I will not let Allie bury me with her legal team,
        publicist, and privilege. I’ve been fighting this lawsuit in my head at 2AM every night for over a week, so it’s ok if I have to
        fight it for real. I tried so hard to be diplomatic with Allie’s team and I’m so upset with myself for that, I’m still learning how
        to stand up for myself.

        Allie’s Swiftball is not a true fantasy game, as such involves the ownership and management of imaginary teams. I’m offering a real
        fantasy platform and if that’s something you’re looking for I hope you’ll enjoy what I’ve built. Every decision a player can make on
        my platform, every question, has been asked and the answers published since the beginning of the tour well before Swiftball was a
        thing. All of that data is loaded into my platform, I offer the best historical data/outcome analysis tools available. Allie built a
        tool to assist fans with an activity they were already doing and I’m entitled to do the same in my own original fashion. We give
        fans the most advanced features currently available, including leagues, drafts, matchups, win-loss records, leaderboards, real-time
        updates, live scoring, and much more. No original features were taken from Allie.

        Allie has made uninformed assumptions that I want to steal your money and steal your information. I take privacy and security
        seriously as a software professional. I use an industry-standard cloud database. Outcomes and leaderboards are software-generated,
        so there’s no need to download user data to a personal computer. If I ever need a volunteer to enter live data, I can grant that
        ability without giving them access to user information. In contrast, Allie needs to share your information with several volunteers
        because they can’t figure out how to write a script to total a spreadsheet. She even publishes the spreadsheets with your handles on
        her Twitter, which new users may not be aware of. Publicly available spreadsheets with 10,000 handles can be very useful to an
        unscrupulous company looking to profit. Allie says she wants to protect her followers, but she and her team are fully unqualified to
        do so. If you’re a software professional, my code is available at github.com/anthony3662 if you’d like to decide for yourself how
        safe my platform is.

        I’ll finish with my thoughts on how Allie’s actions affect the fan community. Taylor’s team has allowed people like Allie, Tess,
        David, etc., to serve the community with their fan projects. They don’t have to treat us this way. There’s past eras where they
        didn’t. Once these projects turn into something more than fan projects, passion projects, once people start wielding publicists and
        legal teams and start suing each other over THEIR GIRL and their intellectual property they’ll reevaluate things. I saw Tessdear’s
        stream get taken down, I don’t want to see more of that. I want the streams, fan projects, and community to stick around for the
        rest of the tour. Allie’s claims and actions infringe both my and Taylor’s IP rights. Allie is trying to trademark another person’s
        name, what might Taylor’s team think of that?

      <Typography variant='body1' component='p' style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
        Allie has had to deal with people who really did copy her work. However, threatening meritless litigation without doing research or
        considering the consequences is not an appropriate solution. The best way to protect a brand is to use original artwork and
        branding, maintain an active online presence, listen to your users, change things up every so often, and keep things fresh. Allie
        has been doing those things, becoming successful as a result. She’ll stay on top if she continues to do those things; there’s no
        need to resort to unethical behavior. I hope Allie will choose to run Swiftball in a productive and positive manner going forward.

        <b>UPDATE July 29 2023</b> Allie's team reached out to me with the following: "Our lawyer has reached Taylor Nation, Taylor Swift’s
        team to make them aware of the trademark and register that trademark alongside Taylor Nation." Despite this new information, I
        continue to be concerned by the legal actions Allie is taking and the potential impact they can have on the fan community. I
        continue to be concerned about what may transpire if Taylor's team became aware of the full extent of the legal threats Allie has
        made and continues to make.
